## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I practiced the information I already knew but I was able to easily center the card on the website, something I wasn't able to do in a previous challenge.

I was able to learn how to overlap images to create a "view image" type effect.


### Continued development

To easily identify the correct CSS style that I need and the correct arrangement for HTML.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) - This helped me to get a better understanding of 'align-items'.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88aBN3N45WA&ab_channel=CodeAgam) - This helped me create the hover effect for the image and only that, I swear :).
